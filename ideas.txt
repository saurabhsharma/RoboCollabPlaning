**IDEAS**

- Shoot an email to everyone and ask them to log time.. the format can be like this - "Hello Ashish!.. thanks for todays hard work.. tell us on what things you have worked on todayâ€¦ it will help us in".

- The native client can also give prompt to user to log their time.

- PM/PLs should get an email every morning with a list of programmers who are not logging their time.
